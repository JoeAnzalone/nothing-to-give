				Your pledge won't be claimed all in one go.
				Rather, I only claim part of your pledge for each milestone I hit, like so:

				<br><br>
				25% claimed if this initial campaign succeeds (March 2014)
				<br>
				25% claimed when I reach the alpha version (estimate: June 2014)
				<br>
				25% claimed when I reach the beta version (estimate: Sep 2014)
				<br>
				25% claimed when the game is finished (estimate: Dec 2014)

				<br><br>
				You can cancel your pledge at any time.
				Because I also update openly on my progress, I will be kept <i>transparent & accountable</i>.
